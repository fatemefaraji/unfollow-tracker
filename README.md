# GitHub Follow/Unfollow Tracker

## Project Description

The GitHub Follow/Unfollow Tracker is a Python-based utility designed to help GitHub users monitor changes in their follower base. This tool addresses the common need for developers and content creators on GitHub to understand their audience growth and engagement patterns over time.

### Problem Statement

GitHub doesn't provide native notifications when users unfollow your account, making it difficult to track engagement metrics and identify patterns in follower behavior. This tool solves that problem by automatically detecting and logging both new followers and unfollowers.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Identifies who has followed or unfollowed your GitHub account since the last check
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains a comprehensive history of all follower changes with timestamps
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides metrics on follower trends over time
- **Rate Limit Friendly**: Respects GitHub API rate limits with built-in pagination and delay mechanisms
- **Command Line Interface**: Simple CLI for easy integration into workflows and automation systems
- **Local Data Storage**: Stores all follower data locally in JSON format for privacy and easy access

### Technical Implementation

The application uses:
- Python's `requests` library for GitHub API interactions
- JSON for data storage and manipulation
- Command-line argument parsing for user interface
- Timestamp tracking for historical data analysis

### Use Cases

- **Content Creators**: Track audience growth after publishing new repositories or content
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Monitor community engagement with projects
- **Professional Developers**: Build and analyze professional networks on GitHub
- **Community Managers**: Track organization account growth and engagement

### Future Development Opportunities

- Web interface for visual analytics
- Email notifications for follower changes
- Integration with GitHub Actions
- Follower analytics and pattern detection
- Cross-reference with repository engagement metrics

### Project Status

This project is ready for production use but welcomes community contributions for feature enhancements and bug fixes.
